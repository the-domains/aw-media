# An Intro to AW Media ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5e6bba9d-6498-4288-82f4-885119213c31.jpg)

The question of who a person is may be one of the fundamental questions of philosophers since before the days of Socrates. However, I do not think there is the time for a lengthy monologue on who I am. 

Instead I will give a morsel of facts about myself, and call it good. I am a mechanical engineering student at Arizona State University. Though my school life, as well as many of my hobbies, revolves around mathematical precision and idealized situations, I have found a recent love for photography. This site will be a small dedication to this more artistic section of my life. Though I cannot promise it will be updated on a weekly basis, I will be posting pictures of my adventures and travels as they come (or as I have time to review the pictures).

I do hope that you will find this site as a convincing break from the everyday hum drum that we all find ourselves in.
